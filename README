Basically, CMB scripts are some scripts that I created to run routine chores related to MD simulations, visualization and analysis. 
I used to use perl for a while but nowaydays, I am trying to use python for small scripts. 
Since I am generally using VMD for visualization, you can find various scripts of VMD for 
	1-Different kinds of RMSD
	2-Different kinds of RMSF
	3-Angle measurements
	3-Normalized distance
	and so on..

I don't claim that they can be directly used but at least, it can give you an idea about the task at hand.

The scripts are classified according to the programming language:
	-VMD scripts, which are in tcl
	-Python scripts (Mostly visualization scripts with matplotlib)
	-Perl scripts
